  "summary": "Diff implements a new HomePage routed at '/', wires CTAs via TanStack Router, updates BottomNav active-state logic, updates OrderStatusPage “Back to Home” to '/', and adds a HomeLiveCounters component with fallback behavior. However, due to truncation, exact homepage copy/section ordering and zone descriptions/footer copy cannot be fully verified. There are also several extra changes (menu data/page, polling hooks, global theme/palette updates) not explicitly requested.",

      "reason": "HomePage.tsx content is truncated; while the file summary claims five sections exist, the diff excerpt does not provide enough text to confirm exact copy, exact CTA labels, full section order, zone descriptions, or footer copy match the draft exactly.",

      "reason": "The Live Counter styling uses a blue accent (text-blue-600 / bg-blue-50) for the “100% Listrik Terjamin (Backup System)” counter, which is not part of the requested earth-tone palette guidance.",
